            <p>My name is Sarah. I'm originally from New York City and I recently moved to San Francisco to further pursue 
                a career in the tech industry. I currently live in the East Bay with
                my boyfriend and a 8-month old puppy, Opie. As a stepping stone to furthering my career in tech, I'm currently attending UC Berkeley's Extension Coding Bootcamp
                which, thus far, has been a great learning experience.
            </p>

            <p>I like to pole dance as a hobby which I took up four years ago, having had learned various 
                tricks and spins. Last year, I competed in a pole dancing competition 
                and won third place in semi-pro. It was a very nerve-wracking but exciting experience!
