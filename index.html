        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My name is Sarah. I am from New York City, and I moved to San Francisco for 
            better opportunities in the tech industry. I currently live in the East Bay with
            my boyfriend and puppy, Opie. I am also attending UC Berkeley's Extension Coding Bootcamp
            and it is really good program.
        </p>

        <p>I like to pole dance on my free time. I have been pole dancing for four years learning various 
            tricks and spins. I competed in a pole dancing competition last year 
            and won third place in semi-pro. It was a very exciting experience!
